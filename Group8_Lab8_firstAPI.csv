Nepal,Saturday Tea Talk,"This is a weekly thread to talk about any topics freely with fellow Nepali dai, bhai, didi, bahini and friends.

Nepal,"Health tip, thanks me later","For 6 months i was living alone, and in these 6 months i was having very bad health, recurring tonsils, throad problem,gas, body ache.

I checked couple of time in private hospital and doc told me it's due to junk food, with surprised i never eat junk food , almost none junk food in my diet, but surprising doc medicine would work in 2/3 days.

On my office closing date , i had some schedule changes, i had to stay late for work and had to go office very morning, so most of the time i had to skipped morning meal and had office didi to make simple food on office.

Then after some days i felt different dispite skipping morning meal i was more healthy,felt fresh no headache. Leter i realised i used to cook food in night and next morning i used to cook leftovers in morning, though myself it can't be , so i did research and find i was eating bacteria all this month. whatever food you left would be growing bacteria after 2 hours . I didn't have fridge so i pretty messed up my health. So if u live alone and don't have fridge never ever eat leftovers foods its dangerous than junk food.",26,11,3phjbz8a,[]
Nepal,November is Men's Mental Health Month. Hoping to spread a little positivity through this.,"With November almost ending, people might have even forgotten that it is men's mental health month. 

According to the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news/item/17-06-2021-one-in-100-deaths-is-by-suicide), males die by suicide at twice the rate of females.  This disparity may be due, in part, to the greater reluctance among males to seek mental health treatment and internalized and social expectations around ‚Äúmasculine behavior.‚Äù 

Nepali men of reddit, what is the best mental health advice you have ever recieved. 

And women, what do you want to say to the men around you regarding mental health?

&amp;#x200B;

For me, I would say 'it is okay to feel.",12,7,7q1lk7tg,[]

Nepal,Why are Nepali people so impeccably dressed?,"I'm not from Nepal, but was recently visiting and wondering why all Nepali people are so impeccably dressed? And when I say impeccable, all the women had their nails, hair, and clothes on point. And men had all the trendy Hallyu inspired haircut and clothing. Is it perhaps the Hallyu wave influence? Or has it always been this way? Do Nepali people pay a lot of attention to one's attire, and appearance?",12,24,9fg5pymn4,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Question/‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∂‡•ç‡§®'}]"
Nepal,Nepal isn‚Äôt a democratic country," Nepal isn‚Äôt a democratic country if it‚Äôs a democratic nation then why are the voices of people being suppressed by not allowing them to protest(not that I support durga prasai or protest but protesting is everyone‚Äôs right in a democratic nation), why was tiktok banned against the will of the citizens, why is the government asking every SNS site account of Nepali to be registered and monitored? They said if they find anything against protocol then we‚Äôll have to delete post within 72hours or something or else the account would be restricted or something. Why was it done? Because people are voicing out their opinions on SNS and are being aware which is a threat to the corrupted system. They‚Äôre gonna monitor everything and control us so where‚Äôs the democracy?? Moreover the blackout regarding the current protest is also concerning. Maybe the protest isn‚Äôt perfect or any good but still media blackout of the protest against government isn‚Äôt done in democratic country, is it?",14,4,edgwjjzd,[]
Nepal,Is it possible to learn driving a car in a month?,"I am thinking to join a driving center to learn driving a car. I don't wanna take long lessons and feel like I could grasp it decently.

Nepal,I am convinced that the government might delay election if they feel like it doesn't go their way,"The way the three major parties sensed real danger to the current system from Durga Prasai, the way they placed him under house arrest, the way they are forcefully suppressing any protests from happening, the way they shut down TikTok so rapidly to suppress this protest make me convinced that the next election would be delayed if the parties feel that it won't go in their favour. 

Believe me, I do think that Durga Prasai is not a good person -- I don't like him from the moment I knew that he is a medical mafia, and how he uses politics for his gain. But I do know that his protests are being suppressed in an undemocratic way. That lessens my trust for the current system. Like people are saying and used to say, if I don't speak up when others' voice is being suppressed, who will speak up when I am being suppressed?

Hopefully, the election on 2084 will occur, and hopefully everyone whose children are abroad realize that the reason those children are abroad is the current system. Hopefully, they will vote in better parties into the system.",34,10,1r2ecqdu,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Politics/‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§®‡•Ä‡§§‡§ø'}]"
