Nepal,Possibility of Remaining Unmarried in the Context of Nepal,"Everyone has their own choices, and for me, I've never desired to get married. I prefer not to shoulder additional responsibilities and accountabilities beyond caring for my parents. Contemplating life after marriage, the thought of the responsibilities and duties associated with children and a spouse overwhelms me.

Therefore, I entertain the idea of staying unmarried and relishing single life until my last breath. To preempt potential challenges in old age, I plan to accumulate a substantial savings in stocks.

My inspiration largely stems from Western culture, which is gaining popularity for embracing unmarried lifestyles and maximizing personal enjoyment.

How many of you are here with similar thinking like of mine? Please put your views forward.

To address any doubts regarding my sexual orientation, I want to clarify that I am a straight male, not LGBTQ.

However, my concern lies in potential resistance from conservative and traditional Nepalese families. Exploring this possibility raises apprehensions about societal expectations and familial norms.",43,53,a83d60y6,[]
Nepal,"I mean, really, waht the actual F ? Earthquake affected people in jajarkot are dying on a daily basis due to cold.","The TikTok ban has garnered more attention and concern, overshadowing the tragic deaths of real people in Jajarkot due to seemingly mundane causes like the ""cold."" It is disheartening that such basic conditions lead to fatalities, especially when the weather is not excessively harsh, like -10 degrees Celsius. The government remains indifferent, as has been the case for a long time, and expectations for positive action are low. However, the societal response is perplexing. Why is there a lack of support, even in providing essential clothing for those already devastated by earthquakes? This critical issue receives minimal attention on social media, with only a handful of small groups offering assistance.  


I remember a quote :  People in poverty are seen merely as numerical data, statistics easily rounded off when the calculations are complete. Poor people are round off numbers.",16,12,onqvrk47,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Rant/गुनासो'}]"
Nepal,How will Nepal be in 25 years?,"Over the past decades, immigration to developed countries like the USA and Australia from Nepal has surged, reaching its peak at this point. During this time, the country's corruption and government instability have fluctuated, generally increasing. In villages and rural areas, there is a noticeable scarcity of youths, and this trend is gradually spreading.

Furthermore, the remaining youth here are increasingly becoming entangled in drug addiction and other dreadful habits that need not be mentioned. While there are more dark sides and challenging situations, mentioning them all leaves me demotivated.

Despite the challenges, we can't ignore the limited progress and positive developments we've experienced in the past few decades. However, I fear that while many countries progress towards more advancement and sophistication in the next twenty-five years, Nepal may fall behind, potentially stagnating or facing worsening situations, failing to keep up with other competitive nations. What are your thoughts on our situation in 25 years?",19,40,a83d60y6,[]

Nepal,Who might be the real robbers?," During a robbery in Zimbabwe, the bank robber shouted to everyone in the bank: ""Don't move. The money belongs to the State. Your life belongs to you."" Everyone in the bank lay down quietly. This is called the ""Mind Changing Concept” Changing the conventional way of thinking.

When a lady lay on the table provocatively, the robber shouted at her: ""Please be civilized! This is a robbery and not a rape!"" This is called ""Being Professional” Focus only on what you are trained to do!

When the bank robbers returned home, the younger robber (MBA-trained) told the older robber (who has only completed Year 6 in primary school): ""Big brother, let's count how much we got."" The older robber rebutted and said: ""You are very stupid. There is so much money it will take us a long time to count. Tonight, the TV news will tell us how much we robbed from the bank!"" This is called ""Experience.” Nowadays, experience is more important than paper qualifications!

After the robbers had left, the bank manager told the bank supervisor to call the police quickly. But the supervisor said to him: ""Wait! Let us take out $10 million from the bank for ourselves and add it to the $70 million that we have previously embezzled from the bank”. This is called ""Swim with the tide.” Converting an unfavourable situation to your advantage! The supervisor says: ""It will be good if there is a robbery every month."" This is called ""Killing Boredom.” Personal Happiness is more important than your job.

The next day, the TV news reported that $100 million was taken from the bank. The robbers counted and counted and counted, but they could only count $20 million. The robbers were very angry and complained: ""We risked our lives and only took $20 million. The bank manager took $80 million with a snap of his fingers. It looks like it is better to be educated than to be a thief!"" This is called ""Knowledge is worth as much as gold!"" The bank manager was smiling and happy because his losses in the share market are now covered by this robbery. This is called ""Seizing the opportunity.” Daring to take risks!

So who are the real robbers here?",46,16,ozydr2wn,[]

Nepal,"Please share your experiences of living in ""Bhada ko Room"" in Kathmandu!","Living in a rented room on the ground floor in Kathmandu has been a unique experience for me. The limited sunlight in my small space, which costs me Rs. 5000 monthly, initially left me perplexed. In contrast to the freedom I enjoyed back home, 600 km away, where despite the size, I had the flexibility to do as I pleased, the transition to Kathmandu for studies brought about discomfort and homesickness in it's initial days. The shift from my mother handling everything to becoming self-reliant was challenging at that time,, requiring significant adjustment. However, through perseverance, I not only adapted but also grew more mature in the process and It has been already more than five years.

My daily routine revolves around a tight schedule, starting with the morning alarm and encompassing tasks like preparing meals and rushing to college. Every rupee is crucial, prompting me to use my student ID for a Rs 10 discount and meticulously mark days on the calendar until the next financial support from my parents arrives. Living within a minimalistic budget, my single room serves as a bedroom, living room, guest room, and kitchen. The constant awareness of my limited financial resources adds an element of fear, making me cautious with every step, especially concerned about potential landlord dissatisfaction.

All these experiences have made me more resilient and resourceful. Navigating the challenges of independent living, budget constraints, and the need for constant adaptation has molded me into a person who values simplicity and financial discipline. Despite the hardships, I hold onto the hope that, one day, having reached my destination, I will be able to build a larger home in Kathmandu—a place that reflects my journey from a small rented room to a space I can truly call my own.

I would love to listen your experiences you have or had while residing here in a rented room, especially in a single minimal rented room not in lavious apartment.",4,0,a83d60y6,[]
Nepal,Bipin Joshi,"There were many foreign nationals who had the misfortune of being abducted by Hamas on October 7. Bipin Joshi, a young Nepali student, was one of them. There was a front page article in the WSJ about Bipin. Recently he was identified as being dragged to Al-Shifa hospital by the terrorists who abducted him.

Why isn’t Nepal doing anything about this? Why aren’t people making noise? Nepal cannot afford to lose young, bright people like this. The future and prosperity of our nation depends on us supporting each other.

Imagine the horror of going abroad to a “developed” country for the first time and you get caught in this kind of terrorist attack. What must be happening to Bipin and his family? 

We need to push for his release.",63,30,7aux58f7,[]

Nepal,What are the different diverse ethnic groups present in Nepal?,"For context, I'm an Indian (woman) and have a lot of Nepali colleagues, travel to Nepal quite often and have great appreciation for the culture, I almost understand the language too and as a South Asian neighbor, I would really love to know more!  I often get confused for someone who's from Nepal, get Spoken to in Nepali always, and people are surprised when I tell them I'm Indian (I'm North Indian from Punjab) to be precise. 
Which makes me believe that there are many different diverse groups in Nepal, and I noticed that in a bigger city like Kathmandu as well. As somebody who's really interested in history, and anthropology,  is there a good resource to study the different ethnic groups in Nepal, their culture and such thats not Wikipedia?

Nepal,in search of a friend,"
I had one friend during my college days who was very intellectual with knowledge in different fields (sports, history, politics, philosophy,movies etc) you just name one and he used to talk about it for hours...So spending time with him made me a different person and i had insights of different things,sometimes he even put the inner thoughts withinme into words with great examples because i am the kind of person who can't put my critical thinking into proper words ,i started reading books, listening to podcasts basically i was a different person back then but eventually he became busy in  life (kt) and we don't talk that much now..
               so i am searching for a friend who is willing to share their intellectual opinion, thoughts,talks with me because i am a lazy person and i know how much work, research,books, podcasts it takes to reach that level ...And i am a good listener and in a level to understand wide range of topics, please feel free to dm if you fit in the category..thank you",6,3,hsdfp4caz,[]
